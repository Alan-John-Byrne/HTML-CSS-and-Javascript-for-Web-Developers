  <h1>Module 4 Solution Starter</h1>
  <div id="box">
  <p>This particular assignment involved only the browsers console to ensure correct output from a Javascript<br>
    file. Here I was putting into practise the knowledge I've gained about the Browsers javascript interpreter.<br>
    So how code within one project related file, will be parsed in relation to any other files contained within that<br>
    same project folder.</p>
  <p>The intended output is a list of names preceeded by either the word "Hello" or "Goodbye". <br>This depended upon the charater at which the name began.</p>
  <p>To check if the Javascript Code has worked as intended, <br>inspect the properties of this page by right clicking and <br>choosing inspect. From there, go to the console tab and view the output.</p>
